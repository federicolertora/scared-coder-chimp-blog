I am on the journey down the path of learning data science and software development. Why the Scared Coder Chimp you ask?  One of the things we all run into when learning something that is new and challenging is fear of the unknown.  There are days when I accomplish a task and feel like a genius and others where I hit a panic inducing wall and behave like a proverbial scared chimp.  This blog will document my struggles and adventures.  Won't you join me?
